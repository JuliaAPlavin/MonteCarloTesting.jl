# MonteCarloTesting.jl

Statistical hypothesis testing via Monte Carlo simulations.

`MonteCarloTesting.jl` performs hypothesis testing based on simulations, even when no analytic solutions are available. The only requirement is to be able to generate synthetic data under the null hypothesis.

See the [Pluto notebook](https://aplavin.github.io/MonteCarloTesting.jl/test/examples.html) for more explanations and usage examples.
